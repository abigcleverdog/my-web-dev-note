# my-web-dev-note
## Overview
To devlep a web app, I will need a program (Python-Falsk) to control the logics of the app, a database (PostgreSQL) to store the data, a html-css-js (Bootstrap, fontawesome, d3.js, ajax, etc.) pack to manage the apperance.
## Installation (reference Udacity guide)
###Git (Install)

###VirtualBox (Install)

###Vagrant (Install and set up environment)

Use Git to fork, then clone, the VM configuration
Windows: Use the Git Bash program (installed with Git) to get a Unix-style terminal. 
Other systems: Use your favorite terminal program.

Log into your personal Github account, and then navigate to the fullstack-nanodegree-vm. 

From the terminal, run:

git clone http://github.com/<username>/fullstack-nanodegree-vm fullstack
This will give you a directory named fullstack that is a clone of your remote fullstack-nanodegree-vm repository. Be sure to replace your username.
